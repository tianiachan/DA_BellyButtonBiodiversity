# DA_BellyButtonBiodiversity

Ever wonder about what is going on with your belly button but been too afraid to ask? We don't pay attention to our belly buttons until there is a cause for concern. We know the basics of what happens when we are born and don't usually pay attention besides that. As an ex bio major turned aspiring data analyst, I had the pleasure to utilize this data set to find out.

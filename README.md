# DA_BellyButtonBiodiversity

Ever wonder about what is going on with your belly button but been too afraid to ask? We don't pay attention to our belly buttons until there is a cause for concern. We know the basics of what happens when we are born and don't usually pay attention besides that. As an ex bio major turned aspiring data analyst, I had the pleasure to utilize this data set to find out. 

# What this is:

* Interactive dashboard designed to study [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) which explores some of the microbial species
(operational taxonomic units (OTU))

# Libraries used:

* [D3](http://learnjsdata.com/read_data.html) to read json file
* Plotly.js for [horizontal bar chart](https://plotly.com/python/horizontal-bar-charts/), [bubble chart](https://plotly.com/python/bubble-charts/), and [gauge chart](https://plotly.com/python/gauge-charts/)
* Bootstrap for [Jekyll Cayman theme](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/jekyll-cayman-theme)

# Tools used:

* Github to host [link](https://tianiachan.github.io/DA_BellyButtonBiodiversity/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as IDE
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) to view program requirements
